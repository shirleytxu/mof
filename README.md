Contour detection of MOFs to measure clump sizes and track movement speed 

The below GIF shows the MOF clumps tracked by contour detection in order from greatest to smallest (the largest clump is labelled 1, the second largest clump is labelled 2, etc). The GIF was taken from microscope imaging and is of MOFs in solution with Dextran and fluorescein salt.
